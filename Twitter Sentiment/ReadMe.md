## Business Problem Framing

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

## Analysis/ Methodology/ Approach

### Create Corpus

A corpus is a large and structured set of text. 

A dataset may have textual information along with some metadata such as time, user etc. A corpus is a particular format of data structure that separate source (actual text to analyze) and meta information in a structured manner.

### Data Cleaning

We apply the following steps to harmonize data.

- Convert all tweets to lower case
- Remove punctuation
- Remove numbers
- Remove stopwords such as of, the etc.
- Remove the word user and u - since @user in a tweet is a stopword
- Remove extra space in between words or sentence.

Note: For this analysis we have removed number, we can use `replace_number()` from the `qdap` package to convert figures to words.

### Create rectangular structure  - DTM

Document-Term Matrix (DTM) is a matrix structure, where document text (each tweet in our analysis) are rows and terms (each word of tweets) are columns

Example of DTM:-

| Text (tweets)  | This | is | a | text | some | more |
|----------------|------|----|---|------|------|------|
| This is a text | 1    | 1  | 1 | 1    | 0    | 0    |
| Some more text | 0    | 0  | 0 | 1    | 0    | 0    |


### Split data 

Split data in train set (75%) and test set (25%).

### Feature enginerring

There are a total of 24,000 words in entire corpus. Most of the are just noise. Hence will ignore words that occur less than 10 times in the entire corpus.

This model assumes for a single tweet repeated word does not make any sense. Therefore, we convert the entire structure to with boolean values.
Eg:- Thank you very very very much means Thank you very much.

## Modeling

### Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes classifier is a family of simple **probabilistic classifiers** based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

The most common use of naive Bayes is for document classification.

### Randomforest model

Random Forests work by training many Decision Trees on random subsets of the features, then averaging/voting out their predictions.
